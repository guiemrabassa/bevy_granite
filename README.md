# Bevy Granite 

This crate provides a way to interactively create, edit, save, and load Bevy data in 3D.


> [!CAUTION]
> This is in early development and you will likely encounter bugs

# Start Here 

<details>
<summary>Getting Started</summary>


Navigate to your projects Cargo.toml and add `bevy_granite`.

```rust
[dependencies]
bevy = "0.16.0"
bevy_granite = { git = "https://github.com/BlakeDarrow/bevy_granite", branch = "main" }
serde = "*"
```

There are 3 optional feature sets.
- Gizmos - Only loads needed content for gizmos. No editor or UI.
- Core - No Editor or Gizmos, just the bare bones needed to use our serial/deserial functions with macros and logging.
- Editor - The same as default features. Includes Gizmos, Core, and all Editor functionality.


## Examples

Next, check out the [examples](https://github.com/BlakeDarrow/bevy_granite/tree/main/examples) which showcase how you can setup a project. 
*Dungeon* provides a simple entry point file with code ready to start editing. Just make sure you copy over the relevant assets subfolder folder or you will get errors.

> If you clone this repo directly, you can use the example argument to launch straight into an example.
> 
> ```ps
> cargo run --release --example dungeon
> ```

### Scene Serialization 

An entity is stored as three main parts:
- **Identity**: Contains the entity’s name, uuid, and type/class (such as Camera, Light, OBJ). This class data contains everything necessary to rebuild this bundle and any other adjacently relevant data. Not everything is currently available in classes.
- **Transform**: Describes the entity’s position, rotation, and scale. This determines where the entity is located and how it is oriented in the world.
- **Components**: (Optional) Holds additional data or behaviors attached to the entity. This is where you extend the entity’s functionality via the `#[granite_component]` macro.

A scene file contains metadata and a list of serializable entity data. Check out the [assets/scenes](https://github.com/BlakeDarrow/bevy_granite/tree/main/assets/scenes) for scene examples.

### Callable Events

While comprehensive documentation is currently unavailable, here are some helpful events you can use to interact with the editor while I write said documentation:

<details>
<summary>Events</summary>

#### Editor Control Events

- `RequestEditorToggle` - Toggle the editor UI on/off
- `RequestToggleCameraSync` - Toggle camera synchronization between editor and main camera

#### Entity Selection Events
- `RequestSelectEntityEvent` - Select an entity (additive for multi-selection)
- `RequestDeselectEntityEvent` - Deselect a specific entity
- `RequestDeselectAllEntitiesEvent` - Clear all entity selections
- `RequestCameraEntityFrame` - Frame the UI camera to focus on active entity

#### Entity Duplication Events
- `RequestDuplicateEntityEvent` - Duplicate a specific entity
- `RequestDuplicateAllSelectionEvent` - Duplicate all currently selected entities

#### Entity Hierarchy Events
- `RequestNewParent` - Request to set active as parent for selected entities
- `RequestRemoveParents` - Remove parent relationships from selected entities
- `RequestRemoveChildren` - Remove child relationships from selected entities

#### World Management Events
- `RequestSaveEvent` - Save the specific world
- `RequestLoadEvent` - Load a world from specified path
- `RequestReloadEvent` - Reload a world from specified path
- `WorldLoadSuccessEvent` - Event sent when world loading completes successfully
- `WorldSaveSuccessEvent` - Event sent when world saving completes successfully
- `RequestDespawnSerializableEntities` - Event to despawn all serializable entities
- `RequestDespawnBySource` - Event to despawn a specific source that is loaded

### Custom UI Callable Events

> Only Bevy Event unit structs are supported for UI button rendering.

With version 0.2.x, there is a new window that renders users buttons that are clickable. Create a struct that holds your events, and add `#[ui_callable_events]`. This will add all the events to the events window as clickable, and will dispatch said event in your struct.

Make sure to call  UI registration before the plugin gets initialized in your app if your using this. `DebugEvents::register_ui();`.

<details>
<summary>Example</summary>

```Rust
use crate::*;
#[derive(Event, Default)]
pub struct DebugRequestPlayer;

#[derive(Event, Default)]
pub struct DebugRequestRemovePlayer;

#[ui_callable_events] 
pub struct DebugEvents {
    pub spawn_player: DebugRequestPlayer,
    pub remove_player: DebugRequestRemovePlayer,
}

pub fn debug_callable_watcher(
    mut despawn: MessageReader<DebugRequestRemovePlayer>,
    mut spawn: MessageReader<DebugRequestPlayer>,
    mut commands: Commands,
    mut player_start: Query<(&GlobalTransform, &mut PlayerSpawner)>,
    mut world_state: ResMut<WorldState>,
) {
    for DebugRequestRemovePlayer in despawn.read() {
        commands.send_event(RequestDespawnBySource(PLAYER_PREFAB.to_string()));
    }

    for DebugRequestPlayer in spawn.read() {
        spawn_player(&mut commands, &mut world_state, &mut player_start);
    }
}
```
